#Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator (GTK-based GUI)

Overview:

This project is a Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator with a GTK-based graphical user interface (GUI). It demonstrates how operating systems handle virtual memory paging and page replacement strategies. 
The simulator supports FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms, tracking page hits and faults dynamically.

Features:

      ✅ Supports FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms
      
      ✅ GUI-based memory access simulation using GTK

      ✅ Displays real-time updates of the Page Table, Main Memory, and Secondary Memory
      
      ✅ Tracks Page Faults and Page Hits
      
      ✅ Allows users to enter logical addresses and choose an algorithm dynamically

Technologies Used:

    *C Programming
    *GTK (for GUI development)
    *Memory Management Concepts (Page Tables, Virtual Memory, Page Replacement)

Usage:

    *Enter a logical address in the text box.
    *Select a page replacement algorithm (FIFO, LRU, or Optimal).
    *Click "Access Memory" to simulate memory access.
    *View Page Table, Main Memory, and Secondary Memory updates in real-time.
    *Click "Reset" to clear memory and restart the simulation.
